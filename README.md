# Introduction
Selenium and BeautifulSoup4 are popular libraries for web crawling, particularly when scraping dynamic web pages that use JavaScript to generate content. Selenium opens a browser window to interact with web pages, mimicking user actions like clicking buttons, filling forms, and scrolling. This enables access to content that isn't immediately available, making it possible to extract dynamic data. Once accessed, BeautifulSoup4 can parse and extract the required information. Combining these libraries creates a powerful web scraper that can extract dynamic content, useful when scraping websites like social media, news, and e-commerce sites.
